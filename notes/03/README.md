In order to view notes that are `.html` files, such as [these](https://github.com/ryantmoore/winter-inst-2023/blob/main/notes/03/01-intro-python.html), open a local version of the file in a browser.

* click the file name
* click the Download button for that file (at right)
* see the raw `.html`
* right-click, save the page source as a file to your Desktop (e.g.)
* if needed, change the extension from `.txt` to `.html`
* open the file in a browser
